# High-throughput-G-estimation-and-compositional-enumeration-of-POSS-structures
This repository contains Python scripts for the combinatorial generation of polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) structures, estimation of their solvation free energy descriptors (ΔG), and aggregation of results into machine-learning-ready datasets. The workflow enumerates POSS cage–substituent compositions, computes additive energetic descriptors based on pre-tabulated Es and Nes values, and organizes the results for downstream analysis, screening, or data-driven modeling.
